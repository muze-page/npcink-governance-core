# npcink-governance-core

Npcink Governance Core is the Npcink AI governance layer for WordPress operations.

npcink-governance-core is the local WordPress AI operation governance control
plane: it classifies, records, approves, preflights, and audits AI-initiated
site operations. It does not plan, execute, route models, run workflows, or own
product UX.

It does not generate content, own product workflows, route models, or replace
the WordPress Abilities API. It discovers agent-callable abilities from
WordPress and provider plugins, then adds host-side policy, proposal review,
approval, commit boundaries, and audit records.

## Scope

This plugin owns:

- ability intake from WordPress Abilities API and provider plugins;
- proposal records for AI-assisted operations;
- approval and commit governance boundaries;
- audit logs for requested, approved, rejected, and committed operations;
- scoped app-key access for external governance clients;
- minimal admin and REST surfaces for governance.

This plugin does not own:

- article generation, SEO writing, media alt generation, or comment reply UX;
- workflow runtime, workflow/task queues, batch execution consoles, MCP
  runtime, or Agent Gateway task catalogs;
- model routing, provider keys, prompt/preset management, or cloud billing;
- reusable WordPress ability definitions, which belong in
  `npcink-abilities-toolkit` or other provider plugins.

## Requirements

- WordPress 7.0+ with WordPress Abilities API available for full ability intake.
- PHP 8.0+.
- Multisite is supported; network activation provisions Core tables for every
  existing site and new sites are provisioned during initialization.
- Deactivation preserves governance records. There is no automatic uninstall
  deletion policy in this release because audit and approval history may be
  subject to site retention requirements. The explicit `uninstall.php` entry
  point is intentionally a no-op.

## MVP REST Surface

MVP routes require `manage_options` or a scoped app key where documented.

- `POST /wp-json/npcink-governance-core/v1/read-requests/{request_id}/read-preflight`
- `GET /wp-json/npcink-governance-core/v1/audit`

The first implementation records proposals, approval/rejection decisions, and
audit events, provides commit preflight without executing writes, records
Adapter-owned post-preflight execution outcomes as proposal lifecycle status, and records
Core-managed sensitive read requests for read abilities that require additional
authorization. Final commit execution is intentionally not implemented until
idempotency and failure contracts are locked and covered by tests.

The `/contract` endpoint is an administrator-only runtime discovery surface. It
returns Core version and contract metadata, handoff route templates, and the
fixed current-stage boundary that Core does not proxy reads, execute final
writes, own workflow runtime, own queues, own MCP runtime, own Agent Gateway
catalogs, or store provider credentials. It also reports Adapter-facing
runtime compatibility, Core truth ownership, and context binding support.
Commit preflight and sensitive-read preflight bind returned contexts to the
current `site_url`, `home_url`, `blog_id`, and, when a trusted Adapter forwards
one, the signed local client fingerprint.

## Development

Use the grouped documentation below before starting a new implementation
session. Governance truth remains in this repository. Cross-project platform
coordination now starts from
`/Users/muze/gitee/npcink-workflow-toolbox/docs/platform/README.md`; non-Core
product, runtime, connector, reference-learning, and release-coordination rules
should not be expanded in Core.

External agent clients can start from the
[OpenClaw governance adapter example](examples/openclaw-governance-adapter/README.md).
That example calls Core REST governance routes only; it is not an MCP runtime
or final write executor.

Third-party ability providers can integrate without adopting
`npcink-abilities-toolkit`: register real WordPress Abilities API ids with
schemas, permission callbacks, risk metadata, and dry-run previews, then submit
write or destructive operations to Core as proposals. See
[Third-Party Ability Provider Guide](docs/third-party-ability-provider-guide.md).

Core 0.4 consumer readiness is complete for the reference
`npcink-abilities-toolkit` 0.4.0 provider across
the `npcink-abilities-toolkit/create-draft`,
`npcink-abilities-toolkit/set-post-seo-meta`, and
`npcink-abilities-toolkit/approve-comment` representative scenarios. See
[Core 0.4 Consumer Readiness](docs/core-0.4-consumer-readiness.md). ADR-003
keeps final WordPress execution outside Core for the current stage; Core
hardens approval context and commit preflight while Adapter/product plugins
execute approved abilities through WordPress Abilities API.

ADR-004 allows the product to move toward one Npcink AI plugin or suite entry
when that improves installation and operator experience. That consolidation
does not collapse authority boundaries: the Governance module remains the
proposal, approval, preflight, and audit truth, while Adapter and Toolbox
modules can serve external channels and local WordPress admin product UX.
Low-risk, single-object, fully previewed actions taken by a present WordPress
administrator may use local admin consent with audit instead of Core proposal
approval. External, automated, batch, destructive, high-impact, or
insufficiently previewed AI writes must still go through Core proposal review.
Core exposes only an audit hook for this path:
`npcink_governance_core_record_local_admin_consent` records bounded
`local_admin_consent.*` events without creating proposals, approving proposals,
preflighting commits, or executing abilities.
The high-risk contrast is still Core proposal review: reviewed article/media
batch plans with draft creation, media upload, media metadata, and
featured-image actions are admitted only as a `plan_to_proposal_batch` through
`POST /proposals/from-plan`; they do not use Local Admin Consent.
ADR-005 makes the current implementation sequence explicit: do not merge Core
into today's OpenClaw Adapter yet. Keep Core independent, treat OpenClaw
Adapter as the first channel adapter, standardize the shared channel adapter
contract, and use the Operation Classification Contract before moving Toolbox
or adapter flows to local admin consent or Core proposal paths.

ADR-006 keeps unattended batch automation out of Core and the OpenClaw Adapter.
Current batch work is reviewed governance only: Toolkit and Toolbox can expose
eligibility, blocked items, retry guidance, and operator next actions; Core
stores `batch_review_summary`; Adapter projects `batch_review_feedback` and
executes nothing until Core approval, commit preflight, and its explicit
allowlist pass. Jobs, leases, retry workers, scheduler state, dead-letter
handling, and unattended approval loops require a separate runtime owner and
contract outside this repository.
ADR-007 names the dedicated runtime owner as
`npcink-local-automation-runtime`. It should be independently developed and
independently testable, while product release packaging may bundle it inside
Toolbox as `modules/local-automation-runtime/` if the module keeps its own
namespace, table prefix, capabilities, kill switch, tests, and boundary docs.
Core no longer keeps the future runtime schema or replay fixture locally; the
future runtime owner must define those artifacts in its own repository.

The taxonomy terms preview extension proves the same boundary for
`npcink-abilities-toolkit/propose-post-taxonomy-terms` -> `npcink-abilities-toolkit/set-post-terms`: adapters
run the read helper through WordPress Abilities API, then submit the generated
dry-run write proposal to Core for approval and commit preflight.

The plan-to-proposal bridge extends that pattern to allowlisted read-only planning
abilities such as `npcink-abilities-toolkit/build-content-inventory-fix-plan`,
`npcink-abilities-toolkit/build-nonproduction-content-cleanup-plan`, and
`npcink-abilities-toolkit/build-media-inventory-fix-plan`,
`npcink-abilities-toolkit/build-media-reference-repair-plan`, and
`npcink-abilities-toolkit/build-media-settings-reference-repair-plan`. It also accepts
`npcink-abilities-toolkit/build-media-optimization-plan` only as a reviewed media
optimization batch where every attachment has paired metadata and derivative actions,
`npcink-abilities-toolkit/build-media-adoption-enhancement-plan` only as one reviewed
batch that uploads a selected remote image, optimizes the new attachment, and
optionally repairs one reviewed post-content reference, `npcink-abilities-toolkit/build-media-rename-plan` only as one reviewed
attachment rename proposal, `npcink-abilities-toolkit/build-pattern-page-plan` only as one
reviewed Gutenberg pattern page batch, `npcink-abilities-toolkit/build-block-theme-site-plan`
only as a reviewed Site Editor template override proposal for the active block theme,
and accepts the P0 Toolbox article handoff
`npcink-toolbox/build-article-write-plan` only as a single reviewed
`npcink-abilities-toolkit/create-draft` proposal. The bounded local article batch handoff
`npcink-toolbox/build-article-batch-write-plan` may create one reviewed
batch of 2 to 5 draft-only `npcink-abilities-toolkit/create-draft` actions. Core accepts the
media-enabled local article batch handoff
`npcink-toolbox/build-article-media-batch-write-plan` only as one
reviewed `article_media_batch_write_plan` with draft creation, media upload,
media metadata, and featured-image actions grouped in a Core batch proposal.
plan output, validates each target ability, stores either one pending proposal
per `write_action` or one `plan_to_proposal_batch` proposal when the plan
explicitly requests batch approval, preserves `preview.before`,
`preview.after_suggestion`, `dry_run=true`, `commit=false`, and article
workflow artifacts where applicable, and keeps final mutation execution outside
Core. See
[Plan To Proposal Governance](docs/plan-to-proposal-governance.md).

Core documentation may use Review Queue, pending proposal queue, bounded bulk
rejection, and `plan_to_proposal_batch` for governance review records. Those terms do not permit workflow/task queue ownership, batch execution, retries,
leases, schedulers, or operator runtime consoles inside Core.

For development-only AI output quality checks, Core can call the sibling Magick
AI Evaluation Lab through opt-in Composer commands such as
`composer eval:lab -- --list`,
`composer eval:project:review -- dry_run=true`, and
`composer eval:gutenberg:judge -- dry_run=true limit=3`. Those commands produce
local review evidence only. They are not part of `composer test:all`, do not
create proposals or audit records, do not store provider credentials in Core,
and are excluded from release packages by `.distignore`. See
[Eval Lab Quality Gate](docs/eval-lab-quality-gate.md).
Use `eval:project:review` for Core boundary-sensitive diffs and
`eval:gutenberg:judge` for Gutenberg plan-quality cases exported by Toolkit or
provider repos. Project review reports stay in the eval-lab
`project-review/generated/` directory and use a redacted repository label
instead of an absolute local path. Typical Core boundary-sensitive diffs touch
audit evidence, proposal persistence, credentials, REST authorization, app
scope, rate limits, eval-lab wrappers, or release packaging.

Article writing is an external product/ability concern, not a Core product.
Core may govern allowlisted local article handoff payloads through
`POST /proposals/from-plan`, but recipe orchestration, Article Assistant UX,
draft generation, research, image selection, and product-side state belong in
Toolbox, Abilities, or another product owner. Cloud must not provide Core with
article drafts, SEO copy, bulk article runs, `article_write_plan` candidates,
or `article_batch_write_plan` candidates.
The accepted product surface is a local Article Assistant Workbench: one
article or bounded reviewed draft batch, reviewed artifacts, and
Core-governed draft proposals, not an article generation product or Cloud
writing feature.

The current governance operability baseline adds proposal audit timelines,
audit filters for ability/app/key/caller/correlation, app scope-decision
attribution, and commit-preflight correlation ids. See
[Core Governance Operability](docs/core-governance-operability.md). This makes
the Core loop easier to review and debug without adding ability execution or a
workflow runtime.

Toolbox stores local media derivative defaults such as output format, max
width, quality, watermark placement, and whether Cloud execution should be used
when available. Core does not own those product settings. It governs the
reviewed media optimization plan that returns from Toolbox/Adapter, while Cloud
Addon may sign and dispatch the request and Cloud may process the derivative
artifact. Final proposal, approval, adoption, and WordPress writes stay local.
When a local media optimization plan combines SEO metadata with derivative
adoption, Core governs it as one `plan_to_proposal_batch` for a single
attachment so the user approves the optimization intent once while Adapter
still validates and executes each write action outside Core. Inline post-content
media reference repair is not a separate batch action in that flow; it belongs
to the local derivative adoption ability's dry-run/commit contract and may be
shown as `content_reference_repairs` evidence in the derivative preview.

The approval policy evaluator defaults to `manual`, records
`proposal.policy_evaluated` for every created proposal, and supports three
bounded strategy modes. `manual` requires approval for every proposal.
`smart_guarded` can auto-approve only trusted
`build-nonproduction-content-cleanup-plan` trash-post batches and single
draft-only `npcink-abilities-toolkit/create-draft` proposals when explicit
authorization, evidence, quotas, and audit all pass. `dev_allow_all` is
local-development only, requires the
`NPCINK_GOVERNANCE_CORE_ENABLE_DEV_ALLOW_ALL` constant, and still requires
commit preflight before Adapter-owned execution. See
[Approval Policy Evaluator Standard](docs/approval-policy-evaluator-standard.md).

Real AI provider request logs remain owned by the WordPress `ai` plugin.
Npcink AI Client Adapter should carry Core `proposal_id` and commit-preflight
`correlation_id` into provider request log context so operators can correlate
Core governance audit with AI Request Logs. See
[AI Provider Log Correlation](docs/ai-provider-log-correlation.md). Core does
not store prompts, responses, token metrics, provider credentials, or provider
request logs.

For Core governance credentials, WordPress administrators can open the
collapsed `Advanced Access` entry from `Npcink AI -> Core` to create a scoped
one-time app token and disable leaked or obsolete keys. This screen is a
governance fallback, not an OpenClaw onboarding surface. Productized OpenClaw
setup, local TLS client configuration, agent rules, and handoff instructions
belong in Npcink AI Client Adapter. Core only issues governance app keys and records
approvals, preflight, rate limits, and audit attribution. The token is shown
once and should be stored only in a trusted Adapter or internal governance
client secret store.

Productized OpenClaw acceptance should be run from Npcink AI Client Adapter's
`docs/openclaw-consumer-acceptance.md`. Core participates as the governance
authority behind Adapter; OpenClaw should not use Core as its primary product
connection.

Cross-repository release candidates that depend on Core, Adapter, and Toolkit
must run [Cross-Repo Release Acceptance](docs/cross-repo-release-acceptance.md).
That gate proves the current chain from signed Adapter request through Core
proposal/preflight, WordPress Abilities API execution, Core execution-result
recording, and Adapter status/readback without moving execution into Core.
