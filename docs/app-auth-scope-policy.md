# App Auth Scope Policy

Status: minimal implementation active.

Npcink Governance Core supports the original `current_user_can( 'manage_options' )`
admin path and a minimal scoped app-key path for external governance clients.
Agent, MCP, product-plugin, and hosted adapter entry must use scoped app
identity when they are not operating as a WordPress administrator.

This is not an OAuth portal, MCP session system, provider credential store, or
workflow runtime.

## Goals

- Identify which app, adapter, or host created each governance request.
- Limit each app to explicit scopes.
- Rate-limit app traffic without moving policy into provider plugins.
- Attribute proposals, approvals, preflight calls, and audit reads.
- Fail closed when identity, scope, rate, or audit checks cannot be completed.

## Non-Goals

Core app auth must not become:

- provider credential storage;
- model routing;
- cloud customer API key management;
- MCP session management;
- OAuth portal implementation;
- workflow or task runtime;
- a replacement for WordPress user capability checks.

## App Identity Model

Core app identity includes:

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `app_id` | Stable public app identifier used in audit and caller metadata. |
| `app_label` | Human-readable admin label. |
| `key_id` | Public key identifier for rotation and audit. |
| `secret_hash` | Hash of the app secret. Never store raw app secrets. |
| `status` | Currently `active`; `revoked` and `expired` are reserved states. |
| `scopes` | Explicit allowed actions. |
| `rate_limit` | Requests allowed per route-family window. |
| `rate_window_seconds` | Fixed-window duration. |
| `expires_at` | Optional UTC expiry. Expired keys fail app authentication with `401`. |
| `token_prefix` | Display-only token prefix for admin copy/paste guidance. |
| `hash_algorithm_version` | Stored hash algorithm label for future migration evidence. |
| `created_by` | WordPress user id that created the app identity. |
| `created_at` | UTC creation time. |
| `last_used_at` | Last successful authentication time. |
| `last_used_ip_hash` | Site-keyed HMAC of the last successful request IP, when available. |
| `revoked_at` | UTC time the key was manually revoked. |
| `revoked_reason` | Optional administrator or system reason for revocation. |

Raw secrets, bearer tokens, HMAC secrets, request signatures, cookies, and
authorization headers must not be stored in proposal or audit metadata. Core
stores only a hash of the last-used IP, never the raw address.

## Initial Scope Set

Use additive scopes. Do not infer permissions from app names, channel names, or
ability ids.

| Scope | Allows |
| --- | --- |
| `capabilities:read` | Read normalized Core capability rows. |
| `proposals:create` | Create proposals for real `ability_id` values. |
| `proposals:read` | List or fetch proposal records. |
| `proposals:approve` | Approve proposals when a trusted host policy is allowed to do so; also authorizes `smart_guarded` cleanup, draft-only create-draft, guarded article-audio, single reviewed media derivative, and reviewed ALT-only media detail auto approval when paired with `proposals:create`. |
| `proposals:reject` | Reject proposals. |
| `commit:preflight` | Request Core-generated approval context for approved proposals. |
| `commit:record_execution` | Record Adapter-owned execution outcome after a matching Core commit preflight. |
| `read_requests:create` | Create Core sensitive read request records. |
| `read_requests:read` | List or fetch sensitive read request records. |
| `read_requests:approve` | Approve sensitive read requests when a trusted host policy is allowed to do so. |
| `read_requests:reject` | Reject sensitive read requests. |
| `read_requests:preflight` | Request bounded Core read authorization context for an approved sensitive read request. |
| `audit:read` | Read audit events. |

Future scopes may add ability-family constraints, but the first version should
avoid wildcard write semantics.

## Scope Rules

- Read-only capability discovery requires `capabilities:read`.
- Proposal creation requires `proposals:create`.
- Proposal approval is high risk and requires `proposals:approve`; most MCP
  adapters should not receive this by default.
- Productized Npcink AI Client Adapter may receive `proposals:approve` only as a
  separately issued trusted Adapter key. That key represents a host-controlled
  UI or policy that has already presented the proposal preview and risk context
  to the user.
- In `smart_guarded` policy mode, an app-created cleanup batch, single
  draft-only create-draft proposal, guarded article-audio proposal, single
  reviewed media derivative adoption proposal, or reviewed ALT-only media
  detail proposal can be auto-approved only when
  the app key carries both `proposals:create` and `proposals:approve`; Core
  still requires trusted evidence, quotas, audit, and commit preflight.
- In `dev_allow_all` policy mode, app-created proposals can be auto-approved
  only in explicit local development mode when
  `NPCINK_GOVERNANCE_CORE_ENABLE_DEV_ALLOW_ALL` is true and the app key carries
  both `proposals:create` and `proposals:approve`.
- Commit preflight requires `commit:preflight` and an approved proposal.
- Execution-result recording requires `commit:record_execution`, a proposal that
  is still approved, and `correlation_id` plus `approved_input_hash` from a
  matching `commit.preflighted` event. Generic preflight-only keys must not be
  able to finalize lifecycle status as executed or failed.
- Sensitive read request creation requires `read_requests:create`; detail/list
  reads require `read_requests:read`; read preflight requires
  `read_requests:preflight` and an approved request bound to the same
  `ability_id` and input hash.
- Sensitive read approval and rejection require `read_requests:approve` and
  `read_requests:reject`. Generic MCP adapters should not receive those by
  default unless a trusted host policy presents the request purpose, data
  classes, bounds, expiry, and redaction level to the user.
- Audit listing requires `audit:read`.
- Write/destructive WordPress execution is outside Core until final commit
  execution is separately designed.

Scopes do not replace WordPress permissions. When a request maps to a WordPress
user, Core should still require the relevant WordPress capability or a trusted
host policy that is explicitly documented.

## Rate Policy

The first app-key implementation supports a simple fixed-window limit:

- per `app_id`;
- per route family;
- bounded to a minimum one-minute window;
- default `60` requests per `3600` seconds.

Rate events should be auditable without storing secrets or raw request bodies.
Rate limit denials emit `app.rate_limited`.

Proposal creation has an additional pending queue guardrail. App-authenticated
callers may have at most 20 pending proposals at a time, and administrator
callers may have at most 1000 pending proposals per user. Repeated creation of
the same `ability_id` with the same sanitized `input` by the same caller
returns the existing pending proposal with `deduplicated=true` instead of
creating another row. Quota denials return
`npcink_governance_core_pending_proposal_quota_exceeded` with HTTP `429`.

## Audit Attribution

Every app-authenticated governance event includes `metadata.auth` with:

- `app_id`;
- `key_id` when available;
- `caller_type`, such as `mcp_adapter`, `agent_host`, `product_plugin`, or
  `internal`;
- required `scope`;
- `scope_decision`, currently `allowed`, `denied`, `expired`, or
  `rate_limited`;
- `route_family`.

The existing `actor_id` column continues to hold WordPress user identity. Pure
app-key requests normally record `actor_id=0` and app attribution in metadata.
Proposal rows also copy the sanitized app auth context into `caller.auth`.

Audit reads can filter by `app_id`, `key_id`, `caller_type`, and
`correlation_id` so operators can trace a specific external app or
commit-preflight response without exposing raw app secrets.

## Authentication Shape

The current implementation uses a bearer app token:

```text
Authorization: Bearer npcink_governance_core.<key_id>.<secret>
```

The same token may be sent as `X-Npcink-Governance-Core-App-Token` for clients that
cannot set the `Authorization` header.

WordPress administrators can issue tokens from either admin-only
`POST /wp-json/npcink-governance-core/v1/apps` or the `Npcink AI -> Core`
Settings `Client access tokens` entry. Both paths use the same app identity
store, default scope policy, and one-time raw-token display rule. The admin
panel shows token management as a low-frequency Settings section, then opens
the token page on an active-token list with a separate read-only revoked-token
audit subtab and a separate issuance subtab using purpose presets and an
advanced custom permission area. It remains a Core credential management
fallback, not the primary OpenClaw product setup flow. Productized OpenClaw
setup should use Npcink AI Client Adapter, which calls Core for governance and
WordPress Abilities API for direct reads.

The admin panel also exposes a minimal token revoke action for active tokens.
Revoking a token marks its status as `revoked`; future requests with that token
return `401`, while historical proposal and audit attribution remains intact.
Revoked tokens are hidden from the default active-token list, available from a
read-only `Revoked tokens` audit subtab, and retained until the Settings
`History retention` cleanup removes old revoked records. Revoked token rows must not expose
restore, reopen, or reissue actions.

LocalWP TLS switches, OpenClaw handoff text, and agent rules belong in
Npcink AI Client Adapter or another client-side adapter layer. Core does not export
`NPCINK_GOVERNANCE_CORE_INSECURE_SSL`, adapter base URLs, or OpenClaw instructions from
the app-key screen.

Minimum requirements:

- raw secret is shown once at creation and stored only as a hash;
- inactive, expired, revoked, or invalid keys return `401`;
- missing scope returns `403`;
- malformed requests return `400`;
- rate-limit failures return `429`;
- all failure responses use stable error codes;
- successful calls update `last_used_at`.

## Initial Consumer Defaults

Recommended defaults:

| Consumer | Default scopes |
| --- | --- |
| MCP adapter | `capabilities:read`, `proposals:create`, `proposals:read`, `commit:preflight`, `read_requests:create`, `read_requests:read`, `read_requests:preflight` |
| Product plugin | `capabilities:read`, `proposals:create`, `proposals:read` |
| Trusted Npcink AI Client Adapter approve-and-execute path | `capabilities:read`, `proposals:create`, `proposals:read`, `proposals:approve`, `commit:preflight`, `commit:record_execution`, `read_requests:create`, `read_requests:read`, `read_requests:approve`, `read_requests:reject`, `read_requests:preflight` |
| Human admin UI | WordPress `manage_options`; no app key required. |
| Hosted runtime callback | No default Core access until callback identity is separately contracted. |

Do not grant `proposals:approve`, `commit:record_execution`, or `audit:read` by
default to generic MCP adapters. A trusted Adapter approval/execution-recording
key should be separate from generic agent keys where practical, should not
include `audit:read` by default, and should be revoked if the Adapter UI or host
policy is no longer trusted.

## Implementation Gates

Current implementation gates:

1. Database schema for app identities and rate counters is documented.
2. REST authentication and error semantics are documented.
3. Security storage and redaction behavior is documented.
4. Admin UI can issue one-time scoped app tokens from a dedicated client access
   token view, point productized OpenClaw setup to Npcink AI Client Adapter, and
   revoke leaked or obsolete keys without exporting Adapter onboarding content.
5. Static contract tests cover scopes, UI entry, revocation, and forbidden
   secret storage.
6. WordPress smoke covers app-authenticated proposal creation, commit preflight,
   denied generic approval, trusted Adapter approval, denied audit access, rate
   limiting, scope-decision attribution, and app audit filters.
