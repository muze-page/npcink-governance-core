# Database Schema

Status: active for MVP.

Npcink Governance Core currently owns five custom tables. They are created during plugin
activation with `dbDelta()`.

## Table: `{prefix}npcink_governance_core_proposals`

Purpose: stores reviewable operation proposals. Proposal rows are lifecycle
records; they are not workflow runtime state.

| Column | Type | Null | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `bigint(20) unsigned` | no | Internal auto-increment primary key. |
| `proposal_id` | `varchar(64)` | no | Public stable id, generated with `wp_generate_uuid4()` when available. |
| `ability_id` | `varchar(190)` | no | Target WordPress ability id. |
| `status` | `varchar(40)` | no | `pending`, `approved`, `rejected`, `expired`, `archived`, `executed`, or `execution_failed`. |
| `title` | `text` | yes | Human-readable title. |
| `summary` | `longtext` | yes | Human-readable summary. |
| `input_json` | `longtext` | yes | Sanitized structured input. |
| `preview_json` | `longtext` | yes | Sanitized dry-run preview or handoff payload. |
| `caller_json` | `longtext` | yes | Sanitized caller metadata, including non-secret Core guardrails and policy decision metadata. |
| `pending_quota_key` | `varchar(190)` | no | Indexed guardrail bucket such as `app:{app_id}` or `user:{user_id}` for pending quota and duplicate checks. |
| `created_by` | `bigint(20) unsigned` | no | WordPress user id. |
| `created_at` | `datetime` | no | UTC time from `current_time( 'mysql', true )`. |
| `updated_at` | `datetime` | no | UTC time from `current_time( 'mysql', true )`. |

`display_id` is not stored as a column. Proposal responses and the admin UI
derive it deterministically from `proposal_id` for human display and lookup,
while `proposal_id` remains the unique persisted identifier.

Indexes:

- primary key: `id`
- unique key: `proposal_id`
- key: `ability_id`
- key: `status`
- key: `pending_quota_key`
- key: `status_quota` on `status`, `pending_quota_key`
- key: `created_at`

Allowed statuses:

- `pending`
- `approved`
- `rejected`
- `expired`
- `archived`
- `executed`
- `execution_failed`

Status transition rules:

- proposals start as `pending`;
- only `pending` proposals may transition to `approved`;
- only `pending` proposals may transition to `rejected`;
- stale `pending` proposals transition to `expired` after the Core pending TTL;
- only `expired` proposals may transition to `archived`;
- `expired` or `archived` proposals may be reopened to `pending` for review;
- only `approved` proposals may transition to `executed` or
  `execution_failed` through a post-preflight execution-result record that
  matches `commit.preflighted` `correlation_id` and `approved_input_hash`;
- MVP status transitions do not execute the target ability.
- lifecycle writes use conditional updates that include the expected current
  status, so stale concurrent requests fail closed instead of overwriting a
  newer state.

## Table: `{prefix}npcink_governance_core_read_requests`

Purpose: stores Core-owned sensitive read authorization requests. Read request
rows are lifecycle records for bounded read approval. They are not proposal
rows, workflow runtime state, execution queues, prompt truth, or read result
storage.

| Column | Type | Null | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `bigint(20) unsigned` | no | Internal auto-increment primary key. |
| `request_id` | `varchar(64)` | no | Public stable id. |
| `ability_id` | `varchar(190)` | no | Target sensitive read ability id. |
| `input_hash` | `varchar(64)` | no | Approved read input hash. |
| `status` | `varchar(40)` | no | `pending`, `approved`, `rejected`, `expired`, or `consumed`. |
| `requested_input_summary` | `longtext` | yes | Sanitized human summary, not raw input. |
| `sensitivity` | `varchar(40)` | no | `internal` or `sensitive`. |
| `data_classes_json` | `longtext` | yes | Sanitized data class list. |
| `redaction_level` | `varchar(80)` | no | `standard` or `strict`; sensitive reads cannot disable redaction. |
| `purpose` | `longtext` | yes | Sanitized review purpose. |
| `caller_json` | `longtext` | yes | Sanitized caller metadata and optional app auth attribution. |
| `bounds_json` | `longtext` | yes | `max_rows`, `tail_lines`, `allowed_fields`, `denied_fields`, and `one_time`. |
| `correlation_id` | `varchar(64)` | no | Correlates preflight grant context with audit. |
| `expires_at` | `datetime` | no | UTC expiry for the grant. |
| `consumed_at` | `datetime` | yes | UTC one-time consumption timestamp. |
| `created_by` | `bigint(20) unsigned` | no | WordPress user id. |
| `created_at` | `datetime` | no | UTC creation time. |
| `updated_at` | `datetime` | no | UTC update time. |

Indexes:

- primary key: `id`
- unique key: `request_id`
- key: `ability_id`
- key: `input_hash`
- key: `status`
- key: `expires_at`
- key: `created_at`

Status transition rules:

- requests start as `pending`;
- only `pending` requests may transition to `approved`;
- only `pending` requests may transition to `rejected`;
- expired requests transition to `expired` before decision or grant;
- approved one-time requests transition to `consumed` after successful
  `read-preflight`;
- status transitions do not execute the read ability.
- lifecycle writes use conditional updates that include the expected current
  status, so stale concurrent decisions, expiry checks, or grants fail closed.

## Table: `{prefix}npcink_governance_core_audit_log`

  `policy_version`, `policy_mode`, `policy_reasons`,
  `auto_approval_applied`, optional auto-approval quota limits, and
  `commit_execution=false`;
- plan intake events include `plan_ability_id`, `batch_id`,

  `policy_version=core-read-authorization-v1`, `commit_execution=false`, and
  `write_execution=false`.

- unique key: `key_id`
- key: `status`
- key: `created_at`

## Table: `{prefix}npcink_governance_core_app_rate_limits`

Purpose: fixed-window rate counters for app-authenticated requests.

| Column | Type | Null | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `bigint(20) unsigned` | no | Internal auto-increment primary key. |
| `app_id` | `varchar(64)` | no | App id. |
| `key_id` | `varchar(64)` | no | Key id used for the request. |
| `route_family` | `varchar(80)` | no | Scope route family, such as `proposals_create`. |

| `request_count` | `int unsigned` | no | Requests used in the window. |
| `created_at` | `datetime` | no | UTC creation time. |
| `updated_at` | `datetime` | no | UTC update time. |

Indexes:

- primary key: `id`
- unique key: `app_route_window` on `app_id`, `route_family`, `window_start`
- key: `key_id`
- key: `window_end`

Existing fixed-window rows are incremented with a conditional SQL update that
requires `request_count < limit`; the unique `app_route_window` key guards
concurrent first writes for the same app, route family, and window.

## Migration Rules

- Schema changes must update this document, `docs/architecture.md`, and
  `tests/run.php`.
- New columns must have deterministic defaults or nullable semantics.
- Do not remove existing columns without an ADR.
- Do not store secrets, provider keys, cookies, passwords, raw request headers,
  or unsanitized user input.
- Sensitive read request rows must not store read result payloads, raw
  authorization headers, cookies, application passwords, private keys, tokens,
  prompt text, or Adapter-owned approval truth.
- App key raw secrets must never be stored; only `secret_hash` is persisted.
- Do not add workflow runtime, queue, retry, lease, or batch execution state to
  these tables.

## Local Smoke Data

`composer smoke:wp` creates local proposal and audit records. That is expected.
The Settings `History retention` policy runs bounded cleanup for old
expired/archived proposal history, revoked client access tokens, and old
low-value access/list audit events. Lifecycle audit events remain governance
evidence; only explicit read/list/view noise such as `proposal.listed`,
`proposal.viewed`, `audit.listed`, `app.listed`, and read request list/view
events are eligible for retention cleanup. Local-only runs may still use smoke
purge helpers for records created by a specific smoke run.
